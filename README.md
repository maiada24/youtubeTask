# Youtube

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.1.3.

## Notes

1- Videos retrieved from youtube server for first time only then will be cached in localstorage.

2- "View Videos" button is disabled unless you enter a channel id, and if invalid id entered, you will get alert with error message.

3- You can sort table with titles and publish date.

4- The table displays only 15 videos from channel, 5 per page. and it's configurable from code.

5- I've created database on firebase to set and get video rate and if it is favorite.

6- In "details.component.html", you can find the commented video in line 3 as i thought that you need to display only video thumbnails,
   if you uncomment this line you will be able to display the youtube video and play it.
   
7- TheÂ application is not mobile responsive.
